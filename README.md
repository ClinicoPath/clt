Simple module for jamovi that helps teaching statistics.
It contains simulations to help students visualize first lessons in probability:
  how and when binomial distribution approximates normal and how Law of big
  numbers and Central Limit Theorem work. Students can visualize correlations of
  different sizes and grasp important concepts when testing hypotheses.

I created it for my teaching because most applets that used to work in the past now stopped working. If you find it useful, it has served it's purpose:)
